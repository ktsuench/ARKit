# ARKit

This project focuses on creating an API in the form of a DLL that exposes OpenCV functionality for use in Unity. Rather than building a native plugin to transfer data from C++ to C# we have opted to use the Emgu OpenCV wrapper which wraps a subset of the OpenCV library for use in .Net compatible languages.

Warning this DLL is not fully tested. It is only a proof of concept.

**This is still a work in progress, hopefully time permits and an API docs is created** (currently as of 2019 April 30).
