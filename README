# ARKit

This project focuses on creating a DLL that exposes OpenCV functionality for use in Unity. Rather than building a native plugin to transfer data from C++ to C# we have opted to use the Emgu OpenCV wrapper which wraps a subset of the OpenCV library.

Warning this DLL is not fully tested. It is only a proof of concept.
